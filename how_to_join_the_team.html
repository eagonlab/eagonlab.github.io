            researchers will primarily work in a hood <a

            lab-based work, you'll be expected to dedicate large blocks
            of time when you're working in lab, <u>averaging 8 hours
              per week</u>.&nbsp; Most students will come for a 3-5 hour
            block of time a couple of times a week. Additionally, we
            will occasionally have group meetings where we'll discuss
            progress with our current topics.&nbsp; If you have a large
            course load and a number of extracurricular activities,
            you'll need to look at your schedule carefully before
            considering research.</small><br>

            written reports.&nbsp; As long as you put time into your lab
            work, usually about 8 hours a week, you will receive
            credit.&nbsp; If you decide to stay with my research group
            after the first quarter, you'll sign up for a 2 unit graded
            research class for each quarter and your senior project will
            be a thesis based on your research that you will submit at
            the end of your senior year (CHEM 461/463).&nbsp; Non
            Chem./Biochem. majors may have to work with their
            departments to make course substitutions as needed, but we
            haven't had any issue doing this in the past.</small><br>

            continues during the summer months as well for those who are

            so that I can pay a certain number of students to work for
            8-10 weeks during the summer.&nbsp; If I am not able to fund
            every interested student, senior students and those who have
            not already received summer funding get priority.&nbsp; If
            you want to work on a volunteer basis over the summer, you
            are more than welcome!&nbsp; There are also often many
            summer research opportunities at other universities, such as
            NSF REU programs at many UC campuses.&nbsp; I will provide
            information about these as they become available.&nbsp; I
            also try to connect students with employment opportunities

            common that I get a number of requests to join each

          <small><small> </small> I always try to take as many students

            my group is full, you may want to consider joining another
            research group.&nbsp; I'm more than willing to discuss other
            research opportunities in the department.&nbsp; There are

            Due to the ever-increasing competitive nature of domestic
            medical colleges, many undergraduate pre-medical students
            feel enormous pressure to fill their resumes with as many
            extra-curriculars as possible, including research.&nbsp; If
            you're passionate about becoming an M.D./D.O., consider
            instead <a

              in the health field</a> by applying for
            internship/shadowing programs that get you in a

              research lab</u> and I don't discourage students
            interested in medicine from asking about my research.&nbsp;
            You may find that medicinal chemistry is more interesting,
            as we get to be on the cutting edge of medicine!&nbsp; Also
            remember that getting a doctorate in chemistry or
            biochemistry for in-state students is still pretty much
            free, as opposed to the <a
